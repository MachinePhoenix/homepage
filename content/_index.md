              Advised by [Prof. Hongkai Xiong](https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyShow/4?Vid=14) and [Prof. Wenrui Dai](https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyShow/4?Vid=20), my researches include:

              * Proposed ICPNet, a unified model capable of representing networks with arbitrary depths with fixed-point iteration layers and any activation function with Chebyshev polynomials, and verified its great properties. (submission for ECCV 2024)
              * Validated the high similarity properties of parameter matrices in LoRa, thereby constructed low-rank decomposition which reduced the required parameter quantity for fine-tuning as well as enhanced performance.

              * Used high-dimensional matrix analysis to clarify the challenges in adversarial training. (Accepted by AAAI 2024)
              * Derived the dynamics characteristics in interactive learning. (Preparing for submission)
              * Designed experimental methods to analyze the robustness of various complexity concepts.
