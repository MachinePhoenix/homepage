I am a first-year M.S. student at [min](https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Prof. Hongkai Xiong](https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyShow/4?Vid=14) and [Prof. Wenrui Dai](https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyShow/4?Vid=20). I received my bachelor’s degree in Electronic Science and Technology from SJTU. 

I have a keen interest in machine learning and interpretable artificial intelligence. I aspire to construct interpretable machine learning systems through mathematical derivations. Specifically, I aim to establish objective metrics to measure model performance and mathematically deduce the factors that contribute to model performance, guiding the design of neural network architectures.
