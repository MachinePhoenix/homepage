abstract: "Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically fail
to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this paper, we mitigate this issue by introducing a complementary RLHF process into the data generation pipeline. By adopting RAFT to refine captions for image-text pairs generated from approximately 50 templates and using reward signals derived from mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, the generated dataset also enhances the general mathematical reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models beyond the domain of geometric problems, yielding accuracy improvements of 3.1%â€“5.5% in arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks even with non-geometric input images."
